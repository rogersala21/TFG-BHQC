# Second hash SHA-256

print("Double SHA-256:", double_hash.hex())  # Returns 32 bytes that need to be processed to generate a valid public key on secp192r1

# The idea is to truncate the 32 bytes to 24 bytes and then use the first 24 bytes as the x coordinate of the public key
# Try then to do 1000 executions to see how many unvalid x's are generated.
