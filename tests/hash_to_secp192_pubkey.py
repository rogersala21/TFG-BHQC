# This script attempts to find a valid point on the secp192r1 curve using SHA-256 hashes of a public key.
# The objective is to get a public key for secp192r1 from a secp256k1 hashed and truncated public key.
# The idea is to truncate the 32 bytes to 24 bytes and then use the first 24 bytes as the x coordinate of the public key on secp192r1.
# Try then to do 1000 executions to see how many unvalid x's are generated.

# To check if the public key on secp192r1 is valid, we will use the equation of the curve finding a valid y coordinate. And then create a known public key to check, and also do a loop to find an invalid x value.
# Also try to find an invalid x value, that is, an x value that does not generate a valid y coordinate on the curve.
